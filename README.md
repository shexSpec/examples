# shex-examples

A collection of scenarios with ShEx schemas and associated data and ShapeMaps collected in manifest files. The examples in this shape repository are deliberately simple. This is not meant to hold particularly useful schemas, but intstead smallish schemas that demonstrate ShEx or some its feature.

* [Issues](scenario/Issues/) - A simple issue-tracking database example. A similar example is in the root.
